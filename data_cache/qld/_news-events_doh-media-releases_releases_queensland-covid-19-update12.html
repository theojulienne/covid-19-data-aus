<p>A public health alert is being issued for contact tracing locations in Moggill, Pullenvale, St Lucia and Wilston.</p><p>This is a reminder for all Queenslanders to keep checking the list of exposure venues on the Queensland Health website and follow the public health advice.</p><p>Contact tracing venues can be found at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.health.qld.gov.au/tracing" target="_blank">http://www.health.qld.gov.au/tracing</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.qld.gov.au/health/conditions/health-alerts/coronavirus-covid-19/current-status/public-health-directions/restrictions-impacted-areas" target="_blank">Lockdown measures</a> are currently in place until 4pm Tuesday and will be reviewed before then.</p><p>We urge&nbsp;<a href="https://www.qld.gov.au/health/conditions/health-alerts/coronavirus-covid-19/current-status/public-health-directions/restrictions-impacted-areas" target="_blank">South East Queenslanders to abide by the lockdown</a> and continue wearing a mask if you must leave your home. Your mask must cover both your mouth and nose.</p><p>We encourage anyone experiencing even the mildest COVID-19 symptoms to get tested and self-isolate until you get your result. Testing helps us find as many cases in the community as quickly as possible.&nbsp;Find your nearest testing location&nbsp;<a href="https://www.qld.gov.au/health/conditions/health-alerts/coronavirus-covid-19/stay-informed/testing-and-fever-clinics" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p>We acknowledge there has been significant demand for testing, which has resulted in long waits at our testing facilities. We thank everyone getting tested for doing the right thing and ask that they please be patient while we work to increase capacity.</p><p>It&rsquo;s up to all of us to follow the rules to help limit the spread of the virus. The virus doesn&rsquo;t move on its own &ndash; people spread it.</p><p>During the lockdown period, you can only leave your residence (which includes temporary accommodation such as a holiday rental) for limited permitted purposes such as:</p><ul><li>Obtaining essential goods or services, including healthcare</li><li>Exercising in your local area &ndash; it can only be within 10km of your home</li><li>Attending essential work or school and childcare for the children of essential workers or vulnerable children</li><li>Assisting a vulnerable persons or family member</li><li>Obtaining a COVID-19 test or vaccination</li></ul><p>People should stay within 10km of their home as much as possible but can go further if it is not possible to achieve a permitted purpose within 10km.
